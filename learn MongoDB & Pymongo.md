# MongoDB and PyMongo

## Overview
This project uses NoSQL databases, mainly MongoDB, with Python. We use PyMongo to connect Python with MongoDB. It's great for handling lots of data, works fast, and can adapt to changes in data.

- **Use SQL** for structured data, complex queries, ACID compliance, data integrity, and advanced reporting. (**ACID Compliance**: Essential when atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability are critical for transactions.)
- **Use NoSQL** for unstructured data, scalability, flexible schema, high-speed operations, and real-time applications.
  
## Why NoSQL?
We use NoSQL because it's great for different kinds of data, can grow with our needs, and is really fast. It's perfect for big projects and apps that need to work in real-time.

## MongoDB
MongoDB is a leading NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented approach for storing data in JSON-like documents. It's known for its:

- **Document-Oriented Storage**: Intuitive storage model, allowing for varied data structures.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Efficient handling of large data volumes and complex queries.
- **Rich Query Language**: Extensive querying capabilities, including text search and geospatial queries.
- **High Availability**: ReplicaSets provide automatic failover and data redundancy.

## Using PyMongo
PyMongo is the Python driver for MongoDB. It allows easy interaction with MongoDB from Python applications. Key features include:

- **Easy for Python Users**: Simple for Python coders to use.
- **Works with Python Stuff**: Fits right in with Python tools and libraries.
- **Full MongoDB Experience**: Lets you do everything MongoDB can do.

## Installation

To set up this project, you need to install MongoDB and PyMongo. You can do this via:
